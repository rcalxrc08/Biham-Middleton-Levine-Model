# Biham-Middleton-Levine-Model [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rcalxrc08/Biham-Middleton-Levine-Model.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rcalxrc08/Biham-Middleton-Levine-Model)
Biham–Middleton–Levine Traffic Model.

This project aims to simulate the evolution of the Biham–Middleton–Levine Traffic Model.

The project objective was to build a program using serial paradigm, OpenMP paralellization and MPI parallelization.

The first two should be ok.
The latter I think that it is bugged but I don't have time to find the bug.
