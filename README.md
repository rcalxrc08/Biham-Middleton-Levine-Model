# Biham-Middleton-Levine-Model [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rcalxrc08/Biham-Middleton-Levine-Model.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rcalxrc08/Biham-Middleton-Levine-Model)
Biham–Middleton–Levine Traffic Model
It is an old code of my Master of Science Course.

This project simulates the evolution of the Biham–Middleton–Levine Traffic Model.

The aim this project was to built a programm using serial paradigm, OpenMP paralellization and MPI parallelization.

The first two should be ok.
The latter i think that it is buggy but i don't have time to find the bug.
